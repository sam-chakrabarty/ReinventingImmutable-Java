## Reinventing Immutable (Java)
### About
This project proudly believes in the holy gospel of **_Reinventing The Wheel Â©_**. 

We will be implementing Immutable/Persistent data structures in Java and benchmarking performance. The goal of this 
project is to iteratively implement the `HashMap`, `LinkedList`, and `Vector` data structures.

## Immutable Hash Map
### Summary
An immutable/persistent HashMap is a map data structure that allows users to carry out transformations without mutating 
existing references of the class. This allows for efficient data sharing, thread safety, and reduction in 
side-effects. 

Our implementation will generally try to follow the ideas set forth in the paper on Hash Array Map Tries 
(HAMT) by Phil Bagwell [[Link](https://lampwww.epfl.ch/papers/idealhashtrees.pdf)].
